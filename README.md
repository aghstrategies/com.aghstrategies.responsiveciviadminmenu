This Extension
--------------

Uses the jquery plugin [slicknav](http://slicknav.com/) to make the CiviCRM administration menu web responsive.

Currently there is one breakpoint at 50em at which point the menu changes from a bar across the top to a hamburger style dropdown menu so that CiviCRM users can more easily navigate thru CiviCRM on small screens (tablets, phones etc.). See some screenshotst of the navigation in action below:

#### Possible future things:

+ Compare length of menu items to width of window and change to small screen menu based on that instead of automatically at 50em

###### Special thanks to Coleman for making this happen.
